First project for CompSci 308 Spring 2015

Name: Le Qi

Date started: Jan 9, 2015

Date finished: Jan 17, 2015

Hours worked: About 20 hours approximately

Resources used: Stack Overflow, JavaFX API, other students in the course about design decisions

Main class file: Main.java

Data (non Java) files needed: None

How to play the game: The objective is to stay alive while shooting the enemies (werewolves represented as red circles). However, if any of the red circles comes in contact with your player (blue circles), then the game is over and you have lost. Using the arrow keys to navigate the player and the mouse click to shoot, you must shoot all of the enemies without getting hurt yourself. There are two different rounds (modes). In the first one, the enemies start moving randomly and simply bounce off the edges of the arena. In the second mode, the enemies know your location and follow you. Beat both of these levels to win the game.

Keys/Mouse input: Up, Down, Left, Right to move in the respective directions; Mouse click to shoot

Cheat Keys: On initial splash screen, if "CHEAT" is typed into the keyboard, the game will start automatically and allow you to fire three bullets at once instead of just one. The code must be entered at the splash screen prior to every game in order to play both rounds with the cheat.

Extra features: Two modes were implemented. In the first mode, objects are given a random initial position and direction, and simply bounces off the edges of the arena. In the second mode, the objects follow you, making it a more difficult task. In either scenario in which you win or lose, clicking the screen allows you to restart the game.
